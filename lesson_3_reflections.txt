Reflection on: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?

First of all, when I want to work together with other peaple. Second, when I want to, 
or have to work from different places on the same project. For example from home and 
from work. And third when I want to use the remote repository as kind of a backup.


Reflection on: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So I will have more control, about what data I get at what time. And I can prevent
confusing my local repo. Also to me it's not clear what happens if I'm currently 
working on a file and than it would be updated.


Reflectin on: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another? 

Fork is the equivalent of clone, but on Github and not localy. So if I'm working 
on my lokal mashine, I have to clone, and if I'm working on GitHub I  have to fork. 
A branch exists on both but as far as I know you have to create a branch localy and 
than push it to GitHub.


Reflection on: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?

The last known state of the remote is an important commit, and it is good to have 
the ability to easy get the difference between this and the current one.
