Reflection on: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?

First of all, when I want to work together with other peaple. Second, when I want to, 
or have to work from different places on the same project. For example from home and 
from work. And third when I want to use the remote repository as kind of a backup.


Reflection on: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So I will have more control, about what data I get at what time. And I can prevent
confusing my local repo. Also to me it's not clear what happens if I'm currently 
working on a file and than it would be updated.
