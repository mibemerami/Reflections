Reflection on: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?

First of all, when I want to work together with other peaple. Second, when I want to, 
or have to work from different places on the same project. For example from home and 
from work. And third when I want to use the remote repository as kind of a backup.
