Reflection on: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you 
need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates a file named ".git", where the 
meta-data for the repo is stored. It is necessary so that git knows that 
this directory is a repo and what the status of that repo is.


Reflection on: How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 

I think it's usefull when you don't want to commit all of the files, in your 
working directory, or maybe not all of them at once. It gives you a little 
bit more control about what to commit.


Reflection on: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one 
commit per logical change?

The staging area helps me to commit files separatly, so if there is a 
logical change per file, I can do a commit per logical change. If there
are more thean one logical changes in one file I don't think the staging 
area can help me. 


Reflection on: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in 
keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Many reasons already have been named, for example: When you want to try 
something experimantal, or you want to change the design, but you first 
want to try the peaoples reaction, before establishing it officialy.
